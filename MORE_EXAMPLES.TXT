In order to filter out sequence that start with DELETE you could use:

    DELETE /foo/bar.xml
    CREATE /foo/bar.xml
    CHANGE /foo/bar.xml

Combined with the following filter:

    typeset previous_file=false
    function custom_filter
    {
        typeset -n return_val=$1
        typeset cmd=$2  # i.e., DELETE/CREATE/CHANGE/...
        typeset file=$3 # i.e., /full/path/to/file
    
        # I noticed a lot of DELETE <file>\nCREATE <file>\nCHANGE <file>\n during compiling.
        # I want to ignore those combinations...
        if ! [[ $previous_file = false ]] && [[ $file = $previous_file ]]; then
            return_val=false
            return
        fi
        previous_file=false
        if [[ $cmd = "DELETE" ]]; then
            previous_file="$file"
            return_val=false
            return
        fi
    
        return_val=true
        return
    }
